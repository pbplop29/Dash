# **_Learnings_**

- Had pushed an API key to github which could have become troublesome. Learnt different ways to tackle and handle such issues.

```
mongoose.connect(
  "mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.vc99n.mongodb.net/Dash?retryWrites=true&w=majority",
  {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
  }
);
```

- Was familiar with RDBMS databases like MySQL, but got familiar with NoSQL using MongoDB.
- Got to learn about the recharts library for charts and graphs
